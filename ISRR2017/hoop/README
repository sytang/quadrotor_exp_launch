TO RUN EXPERIMENTS:

Put parameters in quadrotor_names.yaml, pointload_params.yaml, and goals.yaml.

Run the following scripts to generate the needed files:

./write_vicon_node.py ../config/quadrotor_names.yaml vicon.launch 

./write_files.py ../config/quadrotor_names.yaml test.launch rviz_config.rviz 

./write_rosbag_script.py ../config/quadrotor_names.yaml log_data.sh

chmod +x log_data.sh

Then, launch test.launch, rviz.launch (if you want).

Run run_HOOP.sh.
  
    This script will call HOOP and get trajectories.

    Get the current location of all robots and "assign" a physical robot to a virtual robot index ii (this is so we don't have to deliberately place robots in positions.)

    Take off.

    Go to the start position.

    Execute trajectory.
